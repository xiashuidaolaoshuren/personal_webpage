          I am SO "Felix" Chun Ning, an Artificial Intelligence student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
          Originally from Shenzhen and now living in Hong Kong, I focus my research and studies on Computer Vision 
          and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am deeply passionate about exploring new technologies and staying 
          at the technological frontier. Beyond the world of AI, I am an avid gamer and enjoy staying active 
          through badminton and cycling.
